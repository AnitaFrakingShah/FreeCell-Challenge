# FreeCell-Challenge
FreeCell Free Cell Solitaire designed in Unity  Unfortunately I have not (as of yet) been able to complete this game. Specifically while I managed to create all of the classes I'd want and the layout for the beginning of the game I have still not implemented the game rules.  Specifically, while the free cell and foundation piles have conditional rules applied to them such that only the appropriate number, type, and order of cards can be added to them, I have yet to implement the ability to overlay cards upon eachother within the columns.  If I had had more time there would be a lot of things I would have implemented differently, specifically adding more comments/specs. Cleaning up the code, and trying to incorporate the foundation piles into one overall class rather than a seperate class for each suit.  However, being the first week I have used unity I learned ALOT in terms of how the software works and the observer abilities one can attach to the sprites (physics 2d objects).
